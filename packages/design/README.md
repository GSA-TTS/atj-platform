This package as a special watch task. If your dev server is running already (`pnpm dev`), you can open a separate terminal and run `pnpm test:watch` and any changes to the *.{ts,tsx} files in this package will run the test suite. If you'd like to run from the project root directory, you would run `pnpm --filter @atj/design test:watch`.
