## Potential Impact (1 - 10)
*A quantitative rating of the potential impact on the project if the risk should materialize. Impact in a Risk Register should be scored on a scale of 1 – 10 with 10 being the highest impact.*

<br />


## Probability (1 - 10)
*The likelihood that the risk will occur at some point in the duration of the project. This should be quantitative like Potential Impact not qualitative (high, medium or low). If you use qualitative measures you cannot calculate a Risk Score, which is done by multiplying Probability and Impact and you can easily convert a number to a descriptor e.g. 1-3 = “Low”, 4-6 = “Medium” and 7-10 = “High”.*

## Risk Score (Impact x Probability)

<br />


## Likely Outcome
*The likely consequence or impact of the risk if it materializes.*

<br />


## Prevention and Mitigation
*Action plan to prevent a given risk from occurring, or contingency plans if the risk occurs.*
