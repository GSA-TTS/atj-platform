## Definition of done

The "definition of done" ensures our quality standards are met with each bit of user-facing behavior we add. Everything that can be done incrementally should be done incrementally, while the context and details are fresh. If it’s inefficient or “hard” to do so, the team should figure out why and add OPEX/DEVEX backlog items to make it easier and more efficient.
