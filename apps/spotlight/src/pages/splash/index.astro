  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <p>
    Fillable PDFs are not <a
      href="https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/"
      >21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA) compliant</a
    >. The 10x Access to Justice Platform will empower courts and other
    government agencies to craft web-based replacements to fillable PDFs.
    Delivering first-class user experiences, these easy-to-build and deploy
    digital forms deliver better outcomes for the public and public servants
    through the use of a "guided interview" design strategy. Guided interviews
    put users first and reduce staff time spend on incorrect and missing data.
    Easy to create, easy to host, and integrable with existing processes and
    backend systems â€” digital forms that help self-represented litigants better
    advocate for themselves do not need to wait for major IT and process
    overhauls.

  <h2>What it's not</h2>
  <p>
    Replacing user-facing PDFs with digital forms is not a substitute for deeper
    policy and process changes, which is often necessary to enable the biggest
    digital services wins. We are not replicating case management systems or
    back-office automation systems. Instead, we are delivering a loosely-coupled
    interface to existing systems that delivers a first-class user experience,
    helping the public gain access, understand, and advocate for themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>High level plan</h2>
  <p>
    Taking a user-driven, research-first approach, we are piloting with federal
    and state partners, targeting the high-value PDF-to-web workflow. We plan to
    expand into other government domains as we prove value in the justice space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forward thinking courts are already using open source tools that have
    delivered big wins for their communities. However, we have identified
    critical barriers to adoption. In our ongoing <a
      href="https://10x.gsa.gov/about/what-we-do/">Phase 3</a
    >, we aim to design and demo several loosely-couple parts focused on
    high-value workflows, and build interest from the A2J community. In Phase 4,
    we will scale the system with complete, end-to-end user experiences and
    integrate with backend case management systems. We are building the system
    in a manner that we believe positions it as a viable "Forms as a Service"
    product that may, in the future, more broadly serve other government
    domains.
